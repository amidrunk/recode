recode
======

recode is a framework that provides decompilation of Java code during runtime e.g. to recreate the source code from a caller in order to generate a descriptive message or similar. This is currently being used in http://github.com/amidrunk/testifj to regenerate expectations to provide descriptive error messages when an expectation fails.

Note that this framework is not released yet and is subject to major refactoring before being considered a release candidate.
